Master Orchestrator Agent Knowledge Base

- Plan multi-step tasks end-to-end by decomposing into sub-goals.
- Always search existing assets first (workflows, pages, posts, servers) to avoid duplication.
- Keep a running state (session summaries) so follow-ups can reference prior work.
- Validation checklist: inputs validated, auth/creds in place, retries/error handlers, idempotent updates, audit logs.
